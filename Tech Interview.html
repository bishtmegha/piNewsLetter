									<p><font color="#f37021">You have done your post graduate studies in US what according to you
									are the pros and cons of studying in an American university versus Indian university?</font><br>
									This is a complex question with many nuances&#9786. Broadly I think there are many more high quality 
									education and research opportunities in CS at US universities than in India. The decentralized regulation and
									autonomy to these universities also makes it possible for them to adapt quickly to changing technology trends 
									and innovation in education. 
									</p>
									<p><font color="#f37021">What was the biggest technical challenge you had to overcome 
									while pursuing your doctorate studies?</font><br>
									Two main challenges really: One was to simulate very large deployments of sensor networks to study protocol behaviours. 
									I wrote extensions to the open source NS-2 simulator for some of the experiments and eventually wrote my own simulator. 
									Second, was to understand some of the math and algorithms needed to do research in security and privacy areas. 
									This was a learning challenge because I lacked the foundational background at the time. Overcame mainly through
									coursework and with the help of some smart and patient colleagues who helped explain things.
									</p>
									<p><font color="#f37021">Which technologies did you specialize in?</font><br>
									Privacy and Security technologies in emerging wireless networks.
									</p>
									<p><font color="#f37021">What are the technology areas that you have worked on in the past? 
									Which is one area you enjoy the most?</font><br>
									IP and voice communications, Embedded technologies, Financial services, Wireless networks,
									Security and Privacy, Web Search backend and Analytics. Security and Privacy tech is what I prefer. 
									</p>
									<p><font color="#f37021">You have been in the technology area for the last 17 years during which there have been
									several innovations, which innovation as per you has had a positive impact on our lives and why?</font><br>
									Mobile phone (smart or regular) has been quite profound in its impact particularly in the last couple of decades.

									<p><font color="#f37021">Currently we are seeing IT becoming a key strategy in any business and lot of businesses 
									revolving around IT in the current scenario how do you see the role of a programmer?</font><br>
									We know that, in particular, Digital is becoming central to businesses and I think the role of a programmer is key 
									to enabling it. In the long run programmers should focus on their ability to solve programming and/or data problems 
									rather than a particular language or technology.  
									</p>
									<p><font color="#f37021">Persistent has come up with the EDT pitch to help companies become digital, 
									do you think the same pitch can be made to government organizations as well and how?</font><br>
									Absolutely. We are already seeing both central and local governments toe the Digital line globally.
									From taking governance to the people, to listening to the citizens, to enabling an app ecosystem 
									around the government data and services is where a digital strategy can help governments.
									</p>
									<p><font color="#f37021">E-governance has been a part of the agenda in India for a long time but many of the government
									applications are not usable. Why do you think that government organizations design such poor applications?</font><br>
									Whether it’s a road, a bridge or an application I think getting qualified people with the right intent to do the job,
									is the key to building quality outcomes.
									</p>
									<p><font color="#f37021">As part of the CTO organization you have driven several initiatives like training programs, reskilling, etc.
									Do you think that programmers need to take training or should they be able to learn new technologies on their own.</font><br>
									I wouldn’t say I’ve driven reskilling programs, but I think all of us need to be continually learning to stay relevant,
									productive and grow. You can learn through internal programs, external certifications (which the company partially sponsors) or through 
									free education websites. It has never been easier and more accessible to learn from world class sources , right from our desks. 
									</p>
									<p><font color="#f37021">How do you keep abreast with the latest technologies and which technologies you track more closely?</font><br>
									There’s a lot of online material that I end up reading, predominantly funneled through Techcrunch, 
									Wired, Twitter feed and LinkedIn feed. Broadly I like to read about security, apps and innovation.
